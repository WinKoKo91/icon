### An extended `Icon` for those that are not actually square, plus `shadows` support.

... because Flutter's native [`Icon`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon-class.html 'Flutter API: Icon') ["assumes that the rendered icon is squared"](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/f2a25c5bd2de39a80246370ad53c5bf2e93c81be/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/icon.dart#L24) and that ["non-squared icons may render incorrectly."](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/f2a25c5bd2de39a80246370ad53c5bf2e93c81be/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/icon.dart#L25)

```dart
IconToo IconToo(IconData icon, {Size? trueSize, double? sizeX, double? sizeY, Color? color, List<Shadow>? shadows, AlignmentGeometry? alignment, TextDirection? textDirection, String? semanticLabel})
```
* Support for `AlignmentGeometry` as `IconToo.alignment` is available.
  - But defaults to `Directionality.of` because it is `trueSize`d by design

* ***Note:*** `trueSize` parameter is a `Size` and not a `double`.
- `sizeX` and `sizeY` are available for `const` construction with doubles
  - But not forwarded to [Icon]

* Builds an [`Icon`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon-class.html 'Flutter API: Icon')-akin widget
set inside a [`SizedBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SizedBox-class.html 'Flutter API: SizedBox') constrained by [`trueSize`](https://pub.dev/documentation/icon/latest/icon/IconToo/trueSize.html 'Icon API: trueSize'), with given [`icon`](https://pub.dev/documentation/icon/latest/icon/IconToo/icon.html 'Icon API: icon') data.

* Optionally pass [`color`](https://pub.dev/documentation/icon/latest/icon/IconToo/color.html 'Icon API: color') or [`shadows`](https://pub.dev/documentation/icon/latest/icon/IconToo/shadows.html 'Icon API: shadows').

  * ‚ú® As a bonus, each IconToo supports the `shadows` parameter from [`TextStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/TextStyle-class.html 'Flutter API: TextStyle'), passed as `List<Shadow>` and rendered under an `IconToo`.

* Replete with proper [`Semantics`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html 'Flutter API: Semantics') and [debug `Property`s](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/DoubleProperty-class.html 'Flutter API: DoubleProperty').

# ‚ùì Example with [`IconButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html 'Flutter API: IconButton'):

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: IconToo(
    color: Colors.red,
    CustomIcons.non_square_icon,
    // IconToo passes `fontSize = min(trueSize.width, trueSize.height)` to `TextStyle()`
    trueSize: Size(34.0 * 5, 34.0),
  ),
  // But we need the max() to ensure an IconButton has a diameter that encompasses the entire IconToo
  iconSize: 34.0 * 5,
  onPressed: () {},
);
```
