## [1.0.0+2] - 25 FEB 21

* Looked back at the base [`Icon`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon-class.html 'Flutter API: Icon') class and recognized that [`IconToo`](https://pub.dev/documentation/icon/latest/icon/IconToo-class.html 'Flutter API: IconToo') ought to support [`TextDirection`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/intl/TextDirection-class.html 'Flutter API: TextDirection'), allow a [`Key`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Key/Key.html 'Flutter API: Key') initialization, and properly accept and pass a [`semanticLabel`](https://pub.dev/documentation/icon/latest/icon/IconToo/semanticLabel.html 'Icon API: semanticLabel').
* Added a [second demo](https://github.com/Zabadam/icon_too/blob/main/example/lib/main.dart#L114 'AppBar leading icon in Icon Example app') to the Icon Example app.
* Altered some documentation based on hover hints and DartDoc.
* Updated [README](https://github.com/Zabadam/icon_too#%EF%B8%8F-im-an-icon-too 'Icon Example directory') presentation and sample code.

## [0.1.0+1] - 25 FEB 21

* Initial release as a transfer from an [Android application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zaba.bug_bash 'Bug Bash in the Play Store') on which I am primarily focused.
